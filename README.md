## ⚙️ Automating the Math: Solving Navier-Stokes by Symbolic Computation

One of the coolest parts of this project? We didn’t just crunch equations manually — we **automated** a big chunk of the heavy lifting using **Mathematica** and symbolic algebra.

### 🧠 The Problem

When working with microhydrodynamics (especially in viscoelastic fluids), you're often dealing with:
- Complex versions of the **Navier–Stokes equations**
- Disturbance velocity fields around particles
- Non-linear stress terms from second-order fluid models
- Tons of tensor math with indices, gradients, and reflections

Manually solving these — especially for higher-order approximations — is painfully tedious. Every derivative, every substitution, every boundary condition adds up. And one small mistake can throw everything off.

### 🤖 The Solution: Symbolic Automation with Mathematica

To make life easier (and more accurate), we used **Mathematica notebooks** to automate a lot of this math. Here's what went down:

- **Started with Peery’s approach** (from his 1966 paper) to expand the velocity and pressure fields in powers of small parameters like Reynolds number (Re) or viscoelasticity (λ).
- Represented the flow field using **Stokeslets** and their derivatives.
- Solved zeroth-order and first-order equations using:
  - Built-in **symbolic pattern matching**
  - **Index notation manipulation**
  - Automatic evaluation of divergence, gradients, Laplacians, etc.

This was inspired by the work of Jonas Einarsson in *Computer Algebra for Microhydrodynamics*, where he builds a symbolic engine in Mathematica to handle these exact kinds of problems.

### 🌀 What We Automated

Instead of manually working through pages of algebra, we wrote code that could:

✅ Break down and simplify tensor expressions (e.g., ∇²u - ∇p = f)  
✅ Apply the **Lorentz Reciprocal Theorem** to find migration forces  
✅ Construct the full expressions for disturbance velocities \( v^{(0)}, v^{(1)} \)  
✅ Solve for all unknown coefficients in the solution ansatz  
✅ Automatically apply boundary conditions (force-free, torque-free, etc.)  
✅ Generate lift force integrals in spherical coordinates (for both Newtonian and non-Newtonian cases)

We even implemented a **Fourier Transform-based solution** for particular velocity fields to avoid solving Poisson equations directly — saving loads of time.

### 🔍 Why This Matters

Let’s be real — solving full Navier–Stokes equations with complex boundary conditions is *hard*. But with automation:
- You reduce human error in derivations
- You can explore more complex flow conditions without fear of "too much algebra"
- You make the whole process repeatable, scalable, and verifiable

This symbolic framework opens up a path to **analyze advanced fluid mechanics problems** — like particle migration in non-Newtonian microflows — with more confidence and less grind.
